Software Development Contributions:

* Susan Allen: Lead supervisor, co-developed random_oil_spills.py, co-developed MOHID oil spill fate model, developed post-processing tools.  
* `Rachael Mueller <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/rachaelmueller>`_ : Post-doctoral fellow in charge of coordinating research groups, supervising students, leading development of the random_oil_spill.py code, managing the selection of oil weathering parameters, developing research, developing methods and code (e.g. random_oil_spills.py), analysing Departement of Ecology data, running MOHID model, analyzing output, developing post-processing tools, documenting information, and presenting research. 
* Doug Latornell: Developed MOHID modeling platform on Compute Canada machines, managed software implementation, refined and co-developed random_oil_spills.py, provided software development support for the research team, general backbone for keeping all systems a "go". 
* Ben Moore-Maley: Evaluated surface wind forcing effects on surface currents
* Ashutosh Bhudia: Developed `make_hdf5.py` code, developed code to re-sample HRDPS and WaveWatch III to SalishSeaCast (MOHID) grid, evaluated surface  conditions (e.g.: winds, currents, and tides), ran MOHID model. 
* Vy Do: Developed modules for random_oil_spill.py, ran MOHID oil spill model, evaluated surface  conditions (e.g.: winds, currents, and tides).
* Shihan Li: Refined biodegradation parameterization in the MOHID oil spill fate model and developed MOHID to include Salish Sea Cast, HRDPS, and Wave Watch III (R) inputs. 
* Xiaomei Zhong: Researched Dilbit floculation for developing a Dilbit sedimentation module. 
* Krista Forysinski: Researched ship and marine terminal information to inform and develop oil attribution. 
* Cameron Power: Developed GIS platform and AIS data products used in random_oil_spills.py. Implemented origin and destinations attribution of AIS ship tracks in shapefiles. Researched ship and marine terminal information to inform and develop oil attribution.    
* Casey Hilliard: Developed code for attributing AIS ship tracks with marine terminal origin and destinations.  
* Ryah Rondolo: Researched past oil spills and developed database used to assign spill fraction from cargo capacity.
